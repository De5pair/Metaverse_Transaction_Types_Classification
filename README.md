<h1 align="center">🔐 Metaverse_Transaction_Types_Classification</h1>

<p align="center">A course project submitted to the CSC406 - AI course. A machine learning model was created with the goal of classifying blockchain transaction types into 5 categories:  
(Phishing, Scam, Sale, Purchase, Transfer).</p>

------------------------

## 🧾 Overview

This project applies machine learning to the world of blockchain, aiming to classify transaction types such as **sales, phishing attempts, transfers, scams,** and more.

Our main goal is to enhance **fraud detection** and **transaction profiling** in decentralized ecosystems.

-----------------------

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### 📊 ML Models Used | Accuracy:
- 🌲 **Random Forest**: 97.9%
- 📍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 97.8% 🏆
- 🧮 **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: 69.2%   
- ⚡ **AdaBoost**: 72.9% 

### 🧹 Preprocessing Techniques Applied:

- **Handle Missing Values**: median for numerical values and mode for categorical. 
- **Feature Selection**: using Information Gain.
- **Dropping Irrelevant Features**: Some attributes were dropped after info gain.
- **Min-Max Normalization**: for feature scaling.
- **Encoding:** Applied Label Encoding to different attributes.
- **Oversampling**, **Undersampling**, **Stratified Sampling**, **SMOTE**

### ✨ Performance Evaluation:
Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**
